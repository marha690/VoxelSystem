# Infinitive world generation system 

This project includes a system to create a infinitive world based on voxels similar to games like Minecraft.
The system works by dividing the world in smaller chunks which are generated invidually.
The surface is generated with use of noise-functions and objects are read from .vox-format files.

This is my first C++ project inside Unreal Engine 4.
